  * install dependencies in both client and shop folders
  * set up a database (use  the init.sql for schema, and products.sql to populate the products table)
  * set up environment variables:
     * REACT_APP_STRIPE_PK
     * REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
     * GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
     * GOOGLE_SECRET
     * DB_ADMIN
     * DB_PASSWORD
